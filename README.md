Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 
  The Gaming Room client asked us to create a web-based version of their game, Draw It or Lose It, that was already finding success on Android. The requirements for this specific project included: 
  •	The ability to have one or more teams involved in a game
  •	Each team may have multiple players assigned to them
  •	Game and Team names must be unique
  •	Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
	Throughout this documentation I believe I did particularly well in evaluating the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each operating platform as well as mobile devices for server side, client side and development tools. By creating an easy to understand chart, I can allow the client and others whom may use this document to understand the differences and see which is better for each circumstance. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
	By working through a design document, it is extremely helpful when developing the code due to being able to give each individual working on the code exactly what is required by the client. This document and help eliminate any confusion that may arise. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would improve my recommendations section of this document. I understand what recommendations is best for the client, but putting in on paper was a little difficult. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  By looking at the clients specifications and how each user should expect the game to be played out, I was able to determine which approach to designing the software would fit best. By understanding the user’s needs, you can ensure that each player will experience the game the same without any issues arising. This in turn will help you development reputation as a developer while also allowing your client to run a successful application. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  My main approach was to ensure that each file ran smoothly together without any errors occurring. If an error occurred, I went back to see what had happened and reran the program. By carefully examining where errors occurred, it can make resolving bugs in code must easier.
